# Welcome to ZooTools Challenge!

## About
- This frontend app is my code submission for the Software Internship with ZooTools. 

## Notes
- This site was created with the React library.
- Styling mostly implemented in components since many styles are component specific. General styling is utilized in App.css.
- Flag images found here: [Icon Finder](https://www.iconfinder.com/)
- Emblems in insight panel customized using the Canva website.

## Bugs
- Not quite a bug but needs noted. Site is not responsive for mobile viewing.
- LeaderboardPanel code will likely have issues if there are more than two columns provided in the json data.

## TODO: 
- Create User Leaderboard panel
    - displays different table than LeaderboardPanel
- VisualChartPanel
    - chart
    - background lines
    - 100,000 participants div
    - hover functionality that shows number total of bar
- Button Component at Top Right
- Buttons
    - make buttons modular by creating a button component??
    - change button background color based on which one is active
- MISC.
    - Add Commas within the numbers
    - Behavior Panel headings need shifted over slightly as if there is an invisible element there
    - LeaderboardPanel: add functionality to change data displayed using useEffect()
    - Multiword highlighted text will expand to next line if background highlight is too short e.g. "United States"
    - BarChartPanel Background lines
    - REVIEW CODE TO SIMPLIFY AND IMPLEMENT BETTER CODE MODULARITY WITH COMPONENTS WHERE NECESSARY
